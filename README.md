# Fairness

Welcome to a project named Fairness. Nomen est Omen.

This project leverages the [Distributed Ledger Technology](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture) to build an incentive system which fosters fairness. 

This project supports the [cultdao.io](https://cultdao.io) and is meant to prototype "ecosystem features" for the cult :) 

The cult is represented via many channels to avoid being censored - e.g. on [telegram](t.me/cultdaothemany), [discord](discord.gg/jrTjx4F6Xk), [twitter](https://twitter.com/wearecultdao)

Motivation for this project comes from observing many ["Real Life Thrillers"](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/fun-facts/real-life-thrillers.md) revealing a lack of fairness in political and economic systems.

## Universal Basic Income
The [Fairness Coin (FC)](https://github.com/distributed-ledger-technology/fairness/tree/main/coin) is a newly created currency which enables a Universal Basic Income. It is currently deployed on the Ropsten Test Net. Before the launch on mainnet we will ensure that the mechanisms are sufficiently tested.

One FC is minted per day and per registered wallet (proof of humanity) and automatically transferred to the corresponding registered wallet.

The received Fairness Coins can either be sold or used as governance token in the Fairness DAO aka World Fairness Forum.

## Free Speech
Media shall inform and educate in a "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" pattern - instead of making one-sided politics themselves (the latter is also called propaganda). So we see it in our responsibility to provide or promote a mainstream chatplatform which has a fully decentralized backend and frontend (via ens.domains) including a fully decentralized content moderation and user authentication.

## Decentralized Governance
The [Fairness DAO](https://github.com/distributed-ledger-technology/fairness/tree/main/dao) shall foster real = direct democracy and with that fair systems.

Every registered wallet (proof of humanity) owning at least 1 Fairness Coin is able to post polls and to vote on polls. The voting power is dependent on the amount of fairness coins which are being "betted" by the specific voter on the corresponding answer option.

The specific voter can earn a reward if his chosen answer option turns out to be the majority's opinion. 
The specific voter looses his "betted" FC if his chosen answer option turns out not to be the majority's opinion. 

This mechanism incentivices active voters to vote in the interest of the majority of the community.
