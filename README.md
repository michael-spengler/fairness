# Fairness - A CultDAO Ecosystem Project

Welcome to a project named Fairness. Nomen est Omen.

This project supports the [cultdao.io](https://cultdao.io) and is meant to prototype "ecosystem features" for [the cult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IoAp1f3tVk) :) 

This project leverages the [Distributed Ledger Technology](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture) to build  incentive systems which foster fairness. 

Motivation for this project comes from observing many ["Real Life Thrillers"](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/fun-facts/real-life-thrillers.md) revealing a lack of fairness in political and economic systems.

Contributions (Issues, Pull Requests...) are welcome - feel free to get [in touch](https://t.me/danceplanner).    

You might want to stay up to date about the cult  via [telegram](t.me/cultdaothemany), [discord](https://discord.gg/jrTjx4F6Xk), [twitter](https://twitter.com/wearecultdao), [medium](https://wearecultdao.medium.com/), ...  

If you are a top 50 guardian, wanting to bring this project to the next level, feel free to contact [me](https://t.me/danceplanner) so we can team up for a corresponding [cultdao.io proposal](https://app.cultdao.io/submitProposal). 

## Supporting the RVLT Token
RVLT is the cultDAO's first ecosystem token. Check this [intro](https://youtu.be/PXlGZFZCPdI?t=47). 
There shall be a list of ideas for acts of RVLT - e.g. organized via reddit for simple up- and downvotes based feedback loops.

## Leverage Inspiration from Pulsechain's Pulsepot
Check this [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OIF7jERK4c). 
It might make sense to have something like [https://pulsepot.io/](https://pulsepot.io) for RVLT --> RVLTPot or so.

## Welcome Present 
Newcomers to this project might claim their [Welcome Present](https://cultdao-ecosystem.eth.limo).   
Facebook seems to be the platform with the lowest fake-/real account ratio - this is why [this page](https://cultdao-ecosystem.eth.limo) leverages facebook. If someone has [cooler approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbyVyVNsyys) ready yet, feel free to raise a PR.  

[![1500x500](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43786652/173186666-59020ce5-d29e-457a-94ee-a389471ac2de.jpeg)](https://cultdao-ecosystem.eth.limo)

If this [Welcome Present Feature](https://cultdao-ecosystem.eth.limo) becomes successful in terms of improving the distributedness of our CULT and with that improving the potential for more - real - direct democracy & fairness, we might implement a decentralized / smart contract based backend for it. Especially when it comes to improving the transparency on which insider donated to which newcomer, this might be a great contribution for what RVLT is about to support. 

## Free Speech
Media shall inform, educate and explore in a "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" pattern - instead of making one-sided politics themselves (the latter is also called propaganda). So we see it in our responsibility to provide or promote a mainstream video- & chatplatform which has a decentralized backend and frontend (the latter via ens.domains) including a fully decentralized content moderation and decentralized, permissionless user authentication. 
Spam shall be avoided by punishing spamming wallets financially. This can be done by requesting to stake CULT before someone behind a wallet can post anything --> if the decentralized content moderation comes to the conclusion that someone (behind a wallet) tried to spam the community his stakes shall be given to someone who is respectful and perhaps even helpful for the community.

// Under Construction - Prototyping and Checking if another cultdao.io ecosystem project might already accomplish what is also intended here.

## Peer To Peer On- / Off Ramp
As long as fiat money (= political manipulation money) plays a role, it seems to be a good idea to have several peer to peer on-/off ramps in place. Maybe [cryptolocally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE52OpawDTk) serves as candidate and or inspiration. 

## Peer To Peer Service Exchange
It maybe a good idea to have further approaches like [gitcoin.co](https://gitcoin.co) in place and or to extend gitcoin's features in a way that it also serves as a general decentralized version of [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/). Gitcoin is imo great for web3 insiders. I wonder what is necessary to foster a peer 2 peer economy even further fostering "mainstream adoption"...

## Decentralized Volatility Farming
In order to exploit manipulation induced (non fundamentals based...) volatility, there shall be a smart contract which applies https://deno.land/x/bollinger_bands based swaps between pairs like ETH/CULT. This smart contract shall automatically accumulate ETH, which shall be automatically staked to further stabilize the (PoS) mainnet. This approach could also be applied on other chains of course.

## Decentralized Governance
The [Fairness DAO](https://github.com/distributed-ledger-technology/fairness/tree/main/dao) shall foster real = direct democracy and with that fair systems. It will contain rather day to day decision making features - e.g. comparing it to the [cultdao.io](https://cultdao.io) which is rather focused on relatively bold investment decisions.  

Regarding the Tokenomics of the Fairness Coin in the context of the Fairness DAO, we plan to use a combination of "quadratic voting" and "community oriented feeback loops". 

The specific voter can earn a reward if his chosen answer option turns out to be the majority's opinion. 
The specific voter looses his "betted" FC if his chosen answer option turns out not to be the majority's opinion. 

This mechanism shall incentivize active voters to vote in the interest of the majority of the community.

## Universal Basic Income
The [Fairness Coin (FC)](https://github.com/distributed-ledger-technology/fairness/tree/main/coin) is a newly created currency which enables a Universal Basic Income. It is currently deployed on the Ropsten Test Net in a prototyping mode. Before a potential launch on mainnet we will ensure that the mechanisms are sufficiently tested.

One Fairness Coin is minted per day and per registered wallet (proof of humanity) and automatically transferred to the corresponding registered wallet.

The received Fairness Coins can either be sold or used as governance token in the Fairness DAO aka World Fairness Forum.

## NFT Platform Which Only Accepts CULT for Payments 
You might check the [Prototype](https://github.com/michael-spengler/fairness/tree/main/nft-platform-which-only-accepts-cult-for-payments).  
Having an NFT platform which requires their users to buy and sell via [cult](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cult-dao) might be great.

## General Open Source Rewards
I would appreciate if also web2 public good creators could receive rewards - e.g. for laying the foundation for successful off-chain parts - thinking e.g. about the guys behind [deno.land](https://deno.land/) (Ryan, Lukas, ...). Maybe the [Contributor Assistant](https://github.com/contributor-assistant) could deliver inspirations... on how this could be further facilitated / integrated into those public goods projects.  

## Promotion Info Supporting CultDAO.io
It might be great to have some native speakers (e.g. of top 10 most used languages) translating the manifesto etc. 

## Spread Love & Fairness
... for example by sharing the [cultkamasutra.eth](https://cultkamasutra.eth.limo) / [repo](https://github.com/michael-spengler/cultkamasutra)  

## CULT.DAO Proposals
We consider to [submit a combined proposal](https://app.cultdao.io/submitProposal) to ask the [cultdao](https://cultdao.io) voters if they like our ideas for further features, which are also listed [here](https://github.com/michael-spengler/fairness/blob/main/README.md) and which would need to be detailed out.    
We also consider providing a workflow based on the [contributor assistant](https://github.com/contributor-assistant) to simplify the provisioning of the required parameters - which are:   
1. Name of the Guardian submitting the Proposal   
2. Guardian Discord or Twitter Handle   
3. Guardian Wallet Address   
4. What is the name of the Project?  
5. Provide a short description of the Project, and why it is suitable for investment from the CULT  
6. Please provide either an investment deck, a Litepaper or a whitepaper. This must include your tokenomics, will all current token owners, your projected future fund raise and all details    
7. Provide all social channels associated with the project  
8. Provide links to the audited token and contracts  
9. Provide the percentage of the token supply being offered in return for 13 Ethereum worth of investment (0.25 - 5)  
10. Provide the rate at which the investee token will be swapped for CULT. For example X% per day, week or month, for x number of months  
11. Confirm 50% of the CULT once swapped will be sent to our dCULT contract and 50% sent to a burn wallet  
12. Confirm that the anticipated IDO date is within 12 weeks of the end date of the proposal  
13. Provide the main ethereum wallet for the project        


Some of the key questions which also shall be answered by the proposal (read this in a discord channel and find it reasonable) are:
- what will happen with the 13eth? where will it go? what will we get? etc.  
- why is this a good project for CultDAO?  
- what work will be required in the short term? long term?
