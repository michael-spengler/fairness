# Fairness

Welcome to a project named Fairness. Nomen est Omen.

This project leverages the Distributed Ledger Technology to build an incentive system which fosters fairness. 

Motivation for this project comes from observing many ["Real Life Thrillers"](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/fun-facts/real-life-thrillers.md) revealing a lack of fairness in political and economic systems.
