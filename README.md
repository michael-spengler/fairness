# Fairness - A CultDAO Ecosystem Project

Welcome to a project named Fairness. Nomen est Omen.

This project supports the [cultdao.io](https://cultdao.io) and is meant to prototype "ecosystem features" for [the cult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IoAp1f3tVk) and for the [RVLT](https://revolt.cultdao.io/). 

This project leverages the [Distributed Ledger Technology](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture) to build  incentive systems which foster fairness. 

Motivation for this project comes from observing many ["Real Life Thrillers"](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/fun-facts/real-life-thrillers.md) revealing a lack of fairness in political and economic systems.

Contributions (Issues, Pull Requests...) are welcome. If you are a CultDAO family member ready for [team revolting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVclWqf0yM8), pair programming etc. feel free to get [in touch](https://t.me/danceplanner).

If you are a guardian, wanting to bring this project to the next level, feel free to contact me via [telegram](https://t.me/danceplanner) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/Peer2peerE) so we can team up for a corresponding [cultdao.io proposal](https://app.cultdao.io/submitProposal). 

## Off-Chain Challenges
Leveraging chainlink might be a good idea to connect the On-Chain and the Off-Chain world in reasonable ways - e.g. when it comes to the following challenges / solutions.

### CULT Food

While centralized governments loose their power, they might want to cause chaos to give us some bullshit reasons to be able to introduce their fucked up CBDCs. They can cause such chaos e.g. by preventing people from finding enough to eat.

So it might be a great idea to establish decentralized local food markets where people can pay with CULT, RVLT or Silver.

CULT & RVLT shall cause fear for centralizing politicians etc.   
CULT & RVLT shall cause safety, hope and love for fair people   

In this respect, we might ensure that fair, reasonable people are able to be safe during the downfall of centralized governments. 

I would love to support prototypes paving the way to decentralized local CULT food markets. 

### CULT Schools / CULT Police / CULT Firefighters / CULT Infrastructure (Streets etc.)
As soon as centralized governments are no longer in power, there might be questions like:
1. Do we need a (decentralized) police to enforce fairness in the new system?   
2. If yes: How would this be organzized / incentivized best?


### Universal Basic Income
The time might be right to leverage potential synergies with [democracy.earth](https://democracy.earth/), [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/), etc.

## Rogue Ideas to Fill the Treasury & Boost the Price
We might introduce [RVLTStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/RVLTStreetBets/) to promote flows like: 

1. buy long derivate on CULT or RVLT (to hedge against actors who want to exploit us playing "poker" with open hands (at the CULT family table))
2. community sell CULT or RVLT to lower the price 
3. increase leverage (see 1.)
4. community buyback
5. close the long derivate position (see 1.)

I made the experience that students love to explore mechanisms by exploring things like [Real Life Thrillers](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/fun-facts/real-life-thrillers.md). In this respect I would find it great, if we could collect many more rogue ideas to fill the treasury & boost the price. Exploring and establishing those mechanisms further will be highly educational for people and beneficial for the cult imo. ... It's like the many turning the tide :) I love that.

## CULT Education on Existing Universities & Schools
Introduce and incentivize Distributed Ledger (real democracy) education at schools by rewarding schools who offer this with CULT - improving the Budget situaion for many schools.

Check with Patrick & Sebastian to which extend [HWZ](https://fh-hwz.ch/person/comboeuf-patrick-studiengangsleitung/) and [DHBW Mannheim](https://www.mannheim.dhbw.de) would be interested.  

## Supporting the Distributedness of our Movement
### Welcome Present CULT & RVLT
In order to give people the chance to have a good starting position when it comes to [CULT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cult-dao) & [RVLT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/revolt-2-earn) and in order to increase the distributedness of our movement, we have provided a [welcome present feature for CULT](https://cultdao-ecosystem.eth.limo/) and a [welcome present feature for RVLT](https://rvlt-ecosystem.eth.limo/).  
Facebook seems to be the platform with the lowest fake-/real account ratio - this is why those pages leverage facebook. If someone has [cooler approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbyVyVNsyys) ready yet, feel free to raise a PR.  

[![1500x500](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43786652/173186666-59020ce5-d29e-457a-94ee-a389471ac2de.jpeg)](https://cultdao-ecosystem.eth.limo)

If those welcome present features turn out to be successful in terms of improving the distributedness of our CULT and with that improving the potential for more - real - direct democracy & fairness, we might implement a decentralized / smart contract based backend for it.  

### Leverage Inspiration from Pulsechain's Pulsepot
Check this [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OIF7jERK4c).  
It might make sense to have something like [https://pulsepot.io/](https://pulsepot.io) for RVLT --> RVLTPot or so. We might ask Jacob if he is interested in teaming up.

## Free Speech
Media shall inform, educate and explore in a "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" pattern - instead of making one-sided politics themselves (the latter is also called propaganda). So we see it in our responsibility to provide or promote a mainstream video- & chatplatform which has a decentralized backend and frontend (the latter via ens.domains) including a fully decentralized content moderation and decentralized, permissionless user authentication. 
Spam shall be avoided by punishing spamming wallets financially. This can be done by requesting to stake CULT before someone behind a wallet can post anything --> if the decentralized content moderation comes to the conclusion that someone (behind a wallet) tried to spam the community his stakes shall be given to someone who is respectful and perhaps even helpful for the community.

We shall also find or implement a Peer To Peer Messaging DAPP. Your wallet address would be the replacement of your e-mail address. Spam would be reduced due to the fact that each sender of a message (transaction) needs to pay some minor gas fee --> shall be fine e.g. on Polygon, Arbitrum, Pulsechain and other platforms. 

## Improve censorship resistance of the CULTDAO.io Frontend
Is the [cultdao.io](https://cultdao.io) frontend also available via ipfs? If not provide it and propose to connect it with a proper [https://ens.domains](ens.domains) based ...eth.limo / ...eth.link domain. 

## Peer To Peer On- / Off Ramp
As long as fiat money (= political manipulation money) plays a role, it seems to be a good idea to have several peer to peer on-/off ramps in place. Maybe [cryptolocally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE52OpawDTk) serves as candidate and or inspiration. 

## Peer To Peer Service Exchange
It maybe a good idea to have further approaches like [gitcoin.co](https://gitcoin.co) in place and or to extend gitcoin's features in a way that it also serves as a general decentralized version of [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/). Gitcoin is imo great for web3 insiders. I wonder what is necessary to foster a peer 2 peer economy even further fostering "mainstream adoption"...

## Decentralized Governance For Day To Day Local Decisions
There might be local fairness DAOs to foster real = direct democracy and with that fair systems. 

Regarding the tokenomics of those local fairness DAOs we might use a combination of "quadratic voting" and "community oriented feeback loops". 

The specific voter can earn a reward if his chosen answer option turns out to be the majority's opinion at the end of the voting phase. 
The specific voter looses his "betted" Coins if his chosen answer option turns out not to be the majority's opinion at the end of the voting phase.. 

This mechanism shall incentivize active voters to vote in the interest of the majority of the community.

## NFT Platform Which Only Accepts CULT for Payments 
You might check the [Prototype](https://github.com/michael-spengler/fairness/tree/main/nft-platform-which-only-accepts-cult-for-payments).  
Having an NFT platform which requires their users to buy and sell via [cult](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cult-dao) might be great.

## Provide RVLT Land and or CULT Land
Inspired by the [decentraland.org](https://decentraland.org/), it might be worth considering to implement CULTland and or RVLTland as an additional [cultdao.io](https://cultdao.io) ecosystem project. People would have the chance to buy spaces within those lands and with that they can have digital representations of the stations they came across and loved during their CULT journey.

## Decentralized Volatility Farming
In order to exploit manipulation induced (non fundamentals based...) volatility, there shall be a smart contract which applies https://deno.land/x/bollinger_bands based swaps between pairs like ETH/CULT. This smart contract shall automatically accumulate ETH, which shall be automatically staked to further stabilize the (PoS) mainnet. This approach could also be applied on other chains of course.

## Acts of RVLT Ideas & Feedback
We have posted [this idea collection](https://www.reddit.com/r/cultdao/comments/vov76b/acts_of_rvlt_idea_collection/) to receive feedback from the many for some acts of RVLT which would require a decent amount of investment. There might be synergies with [cultoshi.com](https://cultoshi.com/).


## General Open Source Rewards
I would appreciate if also web2 public good creators could receive rewards - e.g. for laying the foundation for successful off-chain parts - thinking e.g. about the guys behind [deno.land](https://deno.land/) (Ryan, Lukas, ...). Maybe the [Contributor Assistant](https://github.com/contributor-assistant) could deliver inspirations... on how this could be further facilitated / integrated into those public goods projects.  

## Spread Love & Fairness
... for example by sharing the [cultkamasutra.eth](https://cultkamasutra.eth.limo) / [repo](https://github.com/michael-spengler/cultkamasutra)  

## Dance & Laugh
We plan to revitalize the former Dance Planner App.   
Motto: "Dance for Freedom and Find The Perfect Dance Event Within Seconds".  

Centralized Governments might again try to create fear to separate people from each other. 

We want to make sure that it is as simple as never before to get together, dance, laugh in fair contexts while supporting the CULT. 

People will be able to earn CULT or RVLT by dancing and laughing together. 


## CULT.DAO Proposals
We consider providing a workflow based on the [contributor assistant](https://github.com/contributor-assistant) to simplify the provisioning of the required parameters - which are:   
1. Name of the Guardian submitting the Proposal   
2. Guardian Discord or Twitter Handle   
3. Guardian Wallet Address   
4. What is the name of the Project?  
5. Provide a short description of the Project, and why it is suitable for investment from the CULT  
6. Please provide either an investment deck, a Litepaper or a whitepaper. This must include your tokenomics, will all current token owners, your projected future fund raise and all details    
7. Provide all social channels associated with the project  
8. Provide links to the audited token and contracts  
9. Provide the percentage of the token supply being offered in return for 13 Ethereum worth of investment (0.25 - 5)  
10. Provide the rate at which the investee token will be swapped for CULT. For example X% per day, week or month, for x number of months  
11. Confirm 50% of the CULT once swapped will be sent to our dCULT contract and 50% sent to a burn wallet  
12. Confirm that the anticipated IDO date is within 12 weeks of the end date of the proposal  
13. Provide the main ethereum wallet for the project        


Some of the key questions which also shall be answered by the proposal (read this in a discord channel and find it reasonable) are:
- what will happen with the 13eth? where will it go? what will we get? etc.  
- why is this a good project for CultDAO?  
- what work will be required in the short term? long term?
