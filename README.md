# Fairness

Welcome to a project named Fairness. Nomen est Omen.

This project leverages the Distributed Ledger Technology to build an incentive system which fosters fairness. 

Motivation for this project comes from observing many ["Real Life Thrillers"](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/fun-facts/real-life-thrillers.md) revealing a lack of fairness in political and economic systems.

## Universal Basic Income
The Fairness Coin (FC) is a newly created currency which enables a Universal Basic Income. It is currently deployed on the Ropsten Test Net. Before the launch on mainnet we will ensure that the mechanisms are sufficiently tested.

One FC is minted per day and per registered wallet (proof of humanity) and automatically transferred to the corresponding wallet.

The received Fairness Coins can either be sold or used as governance token in the Fairness DAO aka World Fairness Forum.
