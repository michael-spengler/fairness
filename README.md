# Fairness - A CultDAO Ecosystem Project

Welcome to a project named Fairness. Nomen est Omen.

This project supports the [cultdao.io](https://cultdao.io) and is meant to prototype "ecosystem features" for [the cult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IoAp1f3tVk) :) 

This project leverages the [Distributed Ledger Technology](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture) to build  incentive systems which foster fairness. 

Motivation for this project comes from observing many ["Real Life Thrillers"](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/fun-facts/real-life-thrillers.md) revealing a lack of fairness in political and economic systems.

Contributions (Issues, Pull Requests...) are welcome - feel free to get in touch. The cult is represented via many channels to avoid being censored - e.g. via [telegram](t.me/cultdaothemany), [discord](discord.gg/jrTjx4F6Xk), [twitter](https://twitter.com/wearecultdao), [medium](https://wearecultdao.medium.com/)

If you are a top 50 guardian, wanting to bring this project to the next level, feel free to contact [me](https://t.me/danceplanner) so we can team up for a corresponding [cultdao.io proposal](https://app.cultdao.io/submitProposal). 

## Welcome Present 
Newcomers to this project might claim their [Welcome Present](https://peer-2-peer.eth.link).   
Facebook seems to be the platform with the lowest fake-/real account ratio - this is why [this page](https://peer-2-peer.eth.link) leverages facebook. If someone has [cooler approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbyVyVNsyys) ready yet, feel free to raise a PR.

If this [Welcome Present Feature](https://peer-2-peer.eth.link) becomes successful in terms of improving the distributedness of our CULT and with that improving the potential for more - real - direct democracy & fairness, we might implement a decentralized / smart contract based backend for it. Especially when it comes to improving the transparency on which insider donated to which newcomer, this might be a great contribution for what RVLT is about to support. 

## Universal Basic Income
The [Fairness Coin (FC)](https://github.com/distributed-ledger-technology/fairness/tree/main/coin) is a newly created currency which enables a Universal Basic Income. It is currently deployed on the Ropsten Test Net in a prototyping mode. Before a potential launch on mainnet we will ensure that the mechanisms are sufficiently tested.

One Fairness Coin is minted per day and per registered wallet (proof of humanity) and automatically transferred to the corresponding registered wallet.

The received Fairness Coins can either be sold or used as governance token in the Fairness DAO aka World Fairness Forum.

// Under Construction - Prototyping and Checking if another cultdao.io ecosystem project might already accomplish what is also intended here.

## Free Speech
Media shall inform and educate in a "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" pattern - instead of making one-sided politics themselves (the latter is also called propaganda). So we see it in our responsibility to provide or promote a mainstream chatplatform which has a fully decentralized backend and frontend (via ens.domains) including a fully decentralized content moderation and user authentication.

## Decentralized Governance
The [Fairness DAO](https://github.com/distributed-ledger-technology/fairness/tree/main/dao) shall foster real = direct democracy and with that fair systems. It will contain rather day to day decision making features - e.g. comparing it to the [cultdao.io](https://cultdao.io) which is rather focused on relatively bold investment decisions.  

Regarding the Tokenomics of the Fairness Coin in the context of the Fairness DAO, we plan to use a combination of "quadratic voting" and "community oriented feeback loops". 

The specific voter can earn a reward if his chosen answer option turns out to be the majority's opinion. 
The specific voter looses his "betted" FC if his chosen answer option turns out not to be the majority's opinion. 

This mechanism incentivices active voters to vote in the interest of the majority of the community.
