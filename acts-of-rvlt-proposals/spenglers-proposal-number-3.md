## Description
I have programmed the https://cultmagazine.org as a decentralized magazine so that everyone can easily contribute and provide content via pull request.
In the previous round the act was not approved (few approvals were missing) - see act of revolt 993. 
So I decided to lower the requested reward from 0.75 to 0.5 Ether. 
If you vote reject, please send me a message via twitter on why you reject this act of revolt so I can learn something and improve my service for our CULT.
