## Description
I have provided the following community facilitation artefacts. Feedback and Contributions on all of them are welcome.

1. https://github.com/michael-spengler/fairness/blob/main/README.md - really worth reading imo
2. https://cultdao-ecosystem.eth.limo - handing out welcome presents (CULT) - this helps esp. people who are completely new to the space in understanding metamask.io etc. 
3. https://rvlt-ecosystem.eth.limo - handing out welcome presents (RVLT) - as soon as people understood how to use metamask.io the next level is to prepare it for the Polygon Chain --> this is also the sequence how I coach my newbie friends...
4. https://www.reddit.com/r/RVLTStreetBets/ - Pricing Power for CULT & RVLT shall stay in the Hands of The Many - Therefore and to fill the CULT & RVLT Treasuries I'm about to facilitat this community - Feedback = very welcome
5. https://www.reddit.com/r/cultdao/comments/vov76b/acts_of_rvlt_idea_collection/ - I like closing feedback loops because many people learn via feedback --> so it is valuable to me to learn what others think of specific RVLT ideas at a relatively early point in time :)

The main reason why I request a reward is that I want to have CULT & RVLT to scale the approaches mentioned in point 2 & 3. 
Additionally I would be happy if I could completely quit my so-far mainstream job and work for the CULT in a more focused way than I do it so far.
